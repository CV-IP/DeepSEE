	<h1>DeepSEE: Deep Disentangled Semantic Explorative Extreme Super-Resolution</h1>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p><i>Super-resolution (SR) is by definition ill-posed. There are infinitely many plausible high-resolution variants for a given low-resolution natural image. This is why example-based SR methods study upscaling factors up to 4x (or up to 8x for face hallucination). Most of the current literature aims at a single deterministic solution of either high reconstruction fidelity or photo-realistic perceptual quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework, DeepSEE, for Deep disentangled Semantic Explorative Extreme super-resolution. To the best of our knowledge, DeepSEE is the first method to leverage semantic maps for explorative super-resolution. In particular, it provides control of the semantic regions, their disentangled appearance and it allows a broad range of image manipulations.
        We validate DeepSEE for up to 32x magnification and exploration of the space of super-resolution. </i></p>
